The Tangibles
=============

The Tangibles is a student project at [Luleå University of Technology](http://www.ltu.se/) (LTU) that was conducted from September 2012 to January 2013. The purpose was to investigate how WebRTC, image analysis and tangible devices can be used to simplify communication and let users share a common workspace. The project has concluded and the website is no longer available, however, all the source code, [the blog posts](http://the-tangibles.blogspot.com/), [our videos at YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/TheTangibleProject), and [the final project report](https://github.com/stefansundin/The-Tangibles/blob/master/assets/Report.pdf?raw=true), is available. With this information you should be able to make your own prototype.
